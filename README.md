# bubblePop
An iOS bubble pop game

- This project is finished developing, future upgrades on visual enhancements might be considered if time permits.
- Updates on ReadMe might be considered, although it's self-explanatory to use, just open your simulator to play!
- If you hit bubbles of the same colour in a row, you get 1.5 times the original mark for that bubble from the second bubble you hit onwards.
